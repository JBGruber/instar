There are a few different things you can get from Instagram with `instr`:

- Get Posts

```{r}
init_instr()
```

## Login with your Instagram account

Some functionalities (like scraping followers from an account) are only available if you login with your Instagram account.
You can simply run `insta_login()` without any arguments.
This will guide you through the login process and save the login to disk (unless you don't want to, see `?insta_login`).

You can check which logins exist with 


``` r
logged_in_users()
#> [1] "jbgruber1"
```

If you run `insta_login()` again, it will choose the first saved login it finds in your cache directory.
If you have several accounts, you can specify which login to use by supplying a username:

```{r}
insta_login(user = "jandoe195777")
```


## Get information about posts

If you have a list of post URLs or shortcodes, you can query information like this.

```{r}
df <- get_post(x = c(
  "https://www.instagram.com/p/C8XNI2tIZ6Z/",
  "https://www.instagram.com/p/C5gQOiiC08D/"
))
df
```
